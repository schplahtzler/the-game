Game I theorize about

Jim Steve and Bob sit at a table with 10 dollars in the middle. They each get to choose whether to take the money or pass. If someone takes the $10, the game ends. If they all decide to pass, everyone gets a dollar and they go on to the next round where they again get to choose whether to take the money or pass. This continues for 10 rounds. There are also 5 other tables with 3 players playing the same game. The goal is to have the most money at the end of it out of everybody. What's the best strategy?
